# Distro Ave

Distro Ave is a cannabis wholesaler in California. I built this web app for them in June of 2021. Includes an admin dashboard for adding/updating strains and a backend for handling/serving associated strain data.

## Client

Running NextJS and Material UI. [View the live website here](https://distroave.co/).

## Server

Running NodeJS with Express.

### Media

Decided to just host images/videos here because there aren't a ton. Upon recieving an image, this backend generates a variety of thumbnail sizes via [sharp](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sharp).

## Database

Utilized MongoDB Atlas for this project.
